# ENERGY_MANAGEMENT
An Energy Management System (EMS) monitors and analyzes household energy usage to optimize consumption. It uses real-time data like temperature and device usage to predict future energy needs. This project applies machine learning to forecast consumption and support efficient, cost-saving energy decisions.
